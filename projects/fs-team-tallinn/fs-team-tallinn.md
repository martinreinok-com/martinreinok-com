# Formula Student Team Tallinn

I was at the team for 2.5 years during my bachelor studies. This page is a summary of my experiences and projects during that time. This is the team's homepage: [https://www.formulastudent.ee/](https://www.formulastudent.ee/)
<br><br>

## Electronics
<br>

### BSPD

I developed a board called BSPD (Brake System Pausibility Device). It is a non-programmable circuit that prevents driver from accelerating and braking at the same time.
The final design was a 4 layer board, designed using Altium Designer.

### TSAL Light
TSAL is abbreviation for Tractive System Active Light, it is a light mounted to the car, which shows if the car's motors & high voltage elements (tractive system) are active or not.
This was also designed with Altium, and Catia was used to designe the mounting case. The design was quite bulky so this was heavily cut down in the next year, but I would say it looked quite nice :).

### Charger
Charger is used for charging the formula :). The year I joined, the team split into two: electric formula and driverless formula. This also meant we needed a new charger, which I designed and we built it with the team. It features quite an unique normally-closed brake mechanism, air tires for smooth ride and a nice shelf for miscellanious storage. The design is quite large, could be more compact but it worked well for the purpose.

## Software
I contributed to the development of our Formula's Control System. Control System is software layer which runs in near Real-Time and calculates speed or torque setpoints for the motors, based on sensorics data (e.g. IMU, Ground Speed Sensor), gaspedal position and battery power. 
<br>

The software was written in Simulink/C.

## Media
<br>

### YouTube content
I recorded and edited all the competitions that FS Team Tallinn was a part of during 2019.

### Design Wall
The Design Wall was a large backlight wall, with a very high quality renders of the formula on it.
The renders on the wall highlight the complicated parts of the design and made it easier the show the "insides" of the car. It also highlights all of the team's sponsors.  
It probably helped us to win the 2019 Italy design event.

### Sponsor content
I designed some fun sponsor posts as well.

### Calendar
I also designed the team Calendar for the year 2020. Each team member was able to get one, and some were sent out to other student formula teams. Each month in the calendar had FS Team Tallinn can from a different year :)
