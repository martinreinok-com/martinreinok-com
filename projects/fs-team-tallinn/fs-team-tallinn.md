### BSPD

I developed a board called BSPD (Brake System Pausibility Device). It is a non-programmable circuit that prevents driver from accelerating and braking at the same time.
The final design was a 4 layer board, designed using Altium Designer.

### TSAL Light
TSAL is abbreviation for Tractive System Active Light, it is a light mounted to the car, which shows if the car's motors & high voltage elements (tractive system) are active or not.
This was also designed with Altium, and Catia was used to designe the mounting case. The design was quite bulky so this was heavily cut down in the next year, but I would say it looked quite nice :).

### Design Wall
The Design Wall was a large backlight wall, with a very high quality renders of the formula on it.
The renders on the wall highlight the complicated parts of the design and made it easier the show the "insides" of the car. It also highlights all of the team's sponsors.  
It probably helped us to win the 2019 Italy design event.
