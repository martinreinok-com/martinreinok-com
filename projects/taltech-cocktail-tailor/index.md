# Taltech Cocktail Tailor
<br><br>

## Project description
This was a student project in TalTech.  
It was an automation project, with the goal of converting an old CNC machine into a automated Cocktail making machine. 

<br>

My role was mostly software, a bit of CAD and system design as well. I developed C++ code for the motor control on ancient, legacy windows XP and helped to co-create the main loop of the system.
<br><br>

### Final product
Here is an image that has the finished product, by the end of the course

### Making a Cocktail
Well, actually water was used for testing purposes :)
