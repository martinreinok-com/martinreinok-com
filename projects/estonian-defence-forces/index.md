### Custom Debian Distribution
- Built with 'live-build'.
- The ISO was preseeded, meaning clients had to input very little information during installation.
- The Filesystem had all the microservices (docker) pre-installed, previously every service had to be manually installed.

Here is the splash of the Debian install :)
